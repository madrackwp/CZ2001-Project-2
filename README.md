# CZ2001-Project-2

## Things to do:

- ~Create a way to generate random graphs so that we can test our algorithm~
- Extract the files to be tested on from the website in the lab instructions
  - The each pair in the file is a node to node pair, meaning that there will be an edge between them
- Decide on the algorithm and see whether it satisfies the time complexity
  - Recommended to use BFS with the help of a queuegit st

## Useful resources:

- Adjacency List vs Matrix:

# use test.py to generate random graph, change file directory to a blank txt.file in the folder
# use the same txt file and directory when converting random graph to adjacency list format in getgraph() fucntion of readinput.py
