# CZ2001-Project-2

## Things to do:

- `Create a way to generate random graphs so that we can test our algorithm`
- Extract the files to be tested on from the website in the lab instructions
  - The each pair in the file is a node to node pair, meaning that there will be an edge between them
- Decide on the algorithm and see whether it satisfies the time complexity
- Propose the altnertive algorithm
